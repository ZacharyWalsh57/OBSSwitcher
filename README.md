# OBSSwitcher
Switch between OBS Scenes without even realizing using OBSSwitcher! This app allows you to setup screeen bounds by using an app.config file to switch scenes in OBS when your mouse moves to a specified region of the screen.

## How it Works
This app uses the app.config file to setup three regions of screen area to store. Each region is then assigned a hotkey and when the mouse/cursor enters one of those regions, the OBS Window is focused and then the hotkeys are sent to OBS to switch to a new scene.  For more help, check out the App.config included in the source. The comments help walk you through formatting and such.
